# Stella Decks

An HTML slide deck system. Each slide is a self-contained HTML file. Decks are ordered by a manifest. A shared CSS design system provides the visual foundation.

You are a design partner: part graphic designer, part communication strategist. Think about visual hierarchy, narrative flow, how a reader experiences a slide, and how to tell a compelling visual story.

**Before making any visual decisions, read DESIGN.md.** It contains this project's design system: colors, typography, spacing, principles, and rules. If DESIGN.md is empty or still has template placeholders, offer to run the Design Setup workflow (see below).

## How Slides Work

Each slide is self-contained HTML:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="../../styles/deck.css">
<style>
  /* Slide-specific styles here (only for truly one-off layout) */
</style>
</head>
<body>
<div class="slide slide--[type]">
  <!-- content -->
  <div class="slide-num slide-num--[light|dark]"></div>
</div>
</body>
</html>
```

Key rules:
- Container: 1280x720px (16:9), `width: 1280px; height: 720px; overflow: hidden`
- Always link deck.css: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="../../styles/deck.css">`
- Prefer adding reusable styles to deck.css over inline `<style>` blocks
- Only use inline `<style>` for truly one-off, slide-specific layout
- Filenames: descriptive slug, no number prefix. `slide-thesis.html`, not `slide-05.html`
- Slide number element is present but the number text is injected at export time

---

## The Manifest

Each deck has a `manifest.json` that controls slide order:

```json
{
  "title": "My Deck Title",
  "slides": [
    { "file": "slide-cover.html", "label": "Cover" },
    { "file": "slide-thesis.html", "label": "Our Thesis" }
  ]
}
```

- The manifest is the source of truth for sequencing, not filenames
- Cross-deck references: `{ "ref": { "deck": "other-deck", "file": "slide-foo.html" }, "label": "Shared Slide" }`

---

## Component Library

These CSS classes are available in deck.css. Use them by adding the appropriate class names to your HTML elements. Refer to `docs/components.md` for full HTML examples.

### Core Components

| Component | Class | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Slide container | `.slide .slide--[type]` | 1280x720 wrapper |
| Section label | `.section-label` + `--light` or `--dark` | Category marker |
| Slide headline | `.slide-title` / `.slide-title--data` | Serif headline |
| Slide number | `.slide-num` + `--light` or `--dark` | Bottom-right number |
| Slide closer | `.slide-closer` / `.slide-closer--light` | Narrative bridge text |
| Section divider | `.slide--divider` | Full-screen divider slide |

### Layout Patterns

| Pattern | Classes | Use Case |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Cover | `.slide--cover`, `.cover__*` | Opening slide |
| Stats grid | `.slide--glance`, `.glance__card` | 4-column stat cards |
| Thesis/pillars | `.slide--thesis`, `.thesis__pillar` | Content with side cards |
| Domain cards | `.slide--domains`, `.domains__card` | 3-column dark cards |
| Data table | `.slide--data`, `.data-table` | Tabular data |
| Hero case study | `.hero-gradient`, custom layout | Story with metrics |
| Quote block | `.why__*` | Split layout with quote |
| Fund terms | `.slide--terms`, `.terms__card` | Grid of term cards |
| Geographic | `.slide--geo`, `.geo__*` | Regional focus |

### Grid Patterns

- **4-column:** Stat cards. Equal width, 32px gap.
- **3-column:** Domain/pillar cards. Equal width, 24px gap.
- **2-column split:** Left content, right cards (flex 55/45).
- **Full-width rows:** Data tables, track records.

## Editing Rules

**When editing existing slides:**
- Read the current HTML first
- Keep the same class names, patterns, and layout approach
- Preserve the slide-num element and its variant (light/dark)
- The number text is injected at export time; don't hardcode it
- Maintain the voice and tone defined in DESIGN.md

**When creating new slides:**
- Find the most similar existing slide and copy its structure
- Add reusable styles to deck.css, not inline `<style>`
- Class name: `.slide--[descriptive-name]` following BEM conventions
- Add to `manifest.json` in the correct position

**When removing slides:**
- Move the file to `archive/` instead of deleting
- Remove the entry from `manifest.json`

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't hardcode slide numbers in the HTML
- Don't create slides wider or taller than 1280x720
- Respect the rules in DESIGN.md's "What NOT to Do" section

---

## BRIEF.md Convention

Every deck should have a `BRIEF.md`. **Read it before touching any slide in that deck.** It captures:
- What the deck is for and who the audience is
- Whether slides are narrative (persuade) or informational (explain/evidence)
- Key content decisions and what was changed and why
- What to watch out for

Update BRIEF.md when significant decisions are made.

## Workflow

### Preview

Run a local server from the repo root and open the viewer:

```bash
npx serve .
# Then open: http://localhost:3000/viewer/index.html?deck=example
```

The viewer loads slides via fetch from the manifest. Keyboard: arrow keys to navigate, Esc for grid overview, F for fullscreen.

### Export

```bash
node scripts/export-deck.mjs              # PNGs + PDF (example deck)
node scripts/export-deck.mjs my-deck      # Export a specific deck
node scripts/export-deck.mjs --png-only   # PNGs only
node scripts/export-deck.mjs --pdf-only   # Recompose PDF from existing PNGs
```

Output: `exports/{deck}/slides/` (2560x1440 retina PNGs) + `exports/{deck}/{deck}.pdf`

Slide numbers are auto-injected from manifest order during export.

**Do not use Chrome's `page.pdf()` directly.** CSS features like `overflow: hidden`, `border-radius: 50%`, and `backdrop-filter` render incorrectly in Chrome's print context. The screenshot-to-PDF pipeline avoids these issues.

### Markdown Export

```bash
node scripts/export-deck-md.mjs my-deck   # Export deck content as Markdown
```

### Image Generation (Optional)

Generate design-system-aligned images via OpenAI's image API. Requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env`.

```bash
node scripts/generate-image.mjs --prompt "..." --name my-image
node scripts/generate-image.mjs --prompt "..." --template dark-atmosphere --name bg
node scripts/generate-image.mjs --dry-run --prompt "..." --name test
```

Templates: `dark-atmosphere`, `light-spot`, `domain-icon`, `hero-background`, `cover-accent`.

Output: `decks/assets/generated/`

### Undo

`git revert`. Keep commits granular so each change is easy to undo.

## Design Setup

When DESIGN.md contains template placeholders (HTML comments with instructions), the user hasn't configured their design system yet. Offer to help them build it.

### Step 1: Gather inputs

Ask what materials they have:
- Brand guidelines PDF? Upload it.
- Existing deck or presentation? Upload or describe it.
- Website or reference they like the look of? Share a URL.
- Starting from scratch? That's fine too.

If they provide materials, analyze them for: color palette, typography, tone/voice, visual density, use of imagery.

### Step 2: Ask the 6 questions that matter

These are the decisions that determine whether slides look good:

1. **Audience and context:** "Who reads this deck, and how? Investor meeting? Cold send? Conference leave-behind?" (Drives density, formality, pacing)
2. **Emotional register:** "Pick 2-3 words: confident, warm, analytical, bold, restrained, playful, authoritative..." (Drives typography, color, spacing)
3. **Visual reference:** "Show me something that looks like what you want. A website, a deck, a magazine spread, anything." (Most useful single input)
4. **Accent color:** "What color represents your brand? Or: what color do you want the eye drawn to?" (Drives the accent token)
5. **Typography feel:** "Serif headlines (editorial, authoritative) or sans headlines (modern, clean)?" (Drives font choice)
6. **Density:** "One big idea per slide, or pack in the detail?" (Drives padding tiers, font sizes, content rules)

### Step 3: Generate DESIGN.md

Write a complete DESIGN.md based on their answers. Include:
- Specific color hex values (not just "blue" but the exact shade)
- Specific Google Font recommendations
- Spacing values in px
- 3-5 design principles written in their voice
- Clear "do not" rules

### Step 4: Update deck.css tokens

Update the CSS custom properties in `:root` to match the new DESIGN.md. Change `--ink`, `--coral`, `--warm-bg`, `--serif`, `--sans`, and spacing tokens as needed.

### Step 5: Preview and iterate

Ask them to preview the example deck to see if it feels right. Iterate on DESIGN.md and deck.css until they're happy with the look.
